# Course_Work

Codes of a couple of computing courses: (See corresponding branches)

## 1. Course Name: C++ Programming (Programming Language: C++)

In this project, I built a point conversion and trading system in C++. It contains thousands lines, covering the object-oriented programming knowledge points: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, arrays, chains, templates, etc. 

## 2. Big Data Systems (Python) 

In this project, I adopted Python to build a credit rating model for enterprises. Following are main steps.
1. Use Numpy and Pandas to analyze the basic features and transaction data of all logistics enterprises.
2. Use BeautifulSoup to scrapy external information of enterprises.
2. Establish a credit rating model.
3. Get a whitelist of logistics companies. 


## 3. Computational Biology (Python) 
1.	Achieve global alignment of 2 sequences (Dynamic programming). 
2.	Calculate the probabilities and optimal paths of amino acid sequences, using profile Hidden Markov Model. 
3.	Calculate the secondary structure of two rRNA sequences according to the SCFG model (Dynamic programming). 


## 4. Mobile Data Mining (Python & Spark)
1.	Use Spark to process system and use time series model and network model to analyze the traffic data.
2.	(Python) Implement clustering algorithms (Agglomerative hierarchical clustering, K-means, BFR, CURE) on mobile big data.
3.	(Python) Representation Learning Reconstruction embedding & Use collaborative filtering to recommend apps to users
